# Floaty DevTools Panel - Persistent Mode

## How to Use the Persistent DevTools Panel

Since browser extension popups automatically close when clicking outside (this is a Chrome security feature), I've created a DevTools panel version that stays open until you manually close it.

### To Use the Persistent Panel:

1. **Open Chrome DevTools**:
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Or right-click on the page and select "Inspect"

2. **Find the Floaty Panel**:
   - Look for the "Floaty" tab in the DevTools panel (next to Elements, Console, etc.)
   - Click on it to open the persistent Floaty interface

3. **Use the Interface**:
   - The interface will look exactly the same as the popup
   - You'll see a purple pulsing dot indicating it's in DevTools mode
   - It will stay open until you manually close the DevTools or switch to another tab

### Benefits of DevTools Panel:

✅ **Persistent**: Stays open when clicking outside  
✅ **Full Size**: Can be resized to any size you want  
✅ **Always Available**: Accessible from any tab  
✅ **Same Features**: All the same functionality as the popup  

### Alternative: Quick Access

You can still use the regular popup for quick actions:
- Click the Floaty extension icon in the toolbar
- Use it for quick notes or tasks
- It will close when you click outside (normal behavior)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

All the keyboard shortcuts still work:
- `Ctrl+Shift+D`: Toggle dictation
- `Ctrl+Shift+N`: Focus note input
- `Ctrl+Shift+T`: Focus task input
- `Ctrl+Shift+S`: Switch to saved items
- `/`: Toggle global search

### Note

The DevTools panel is the recommended way to use Floaty for extended note-taking and task management sessions, while the popup is perfect for quick actions.
