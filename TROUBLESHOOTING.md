# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ðŸ”„ "Extension context became invalid" Error

**What it means:**
- This error occurs when the extension context is lost
- It's normal when reloading the extension

**Solutions:**
1. **Refresh the page** - This is the simplest solution
2. **Reload the extension** - Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the refresh button
3. **Wait for auto-reconnection** - The extension will try to reconnect automatically

**When to worry:**
- Only if the error persists after refreshing the page
- Only if features stop working completely

3. This panel stays open until you manually close it

2. **Close and reopen DevTools:**
   - Close DevTools completely
   - Press `F12` again to reopen

3. **Check extension is enabled:**
   - Make sure the extension toggle is ON in `chrome://extensions/`

### ðŸŽ¤ Speech Recognition Not Working

**Common causes:**

**Solutions:**
1. **Allow microphone access** when prompted
2. **Check browser settings** for microphone permissions
3. **Refresh the page** if extension context is lost

### ðŸ’¾ Data Not Saving

**If notes/tasks aren't being saved:**

1. **Check storage permissions:**

   - Find "Floaty" and click "Details"
   - Make sure "Storage" permission is enabled

   - Look for "chrome-extension://[extension-id]"

### ðŸ”‘ Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

**If shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+D aren't working:**

1. **Check for conflicts:**
   - Other extensions might be using the same shortcuts
   - Check `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`

2. **Refresh the page** to restore extension context

3. **Use the interface buttons** instead of shortcuts
